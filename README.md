# Selfie-detection

This is the code which corresponds to the paper [Selfie Detection by Synergy-Constraint Based Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04357.pdf).
The trained model is available [here] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx29lDRnBmOEZE10ck9KdGI1MW8). 

Please download [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and install according to the instructions.
In order to extract Selfie Descriptors, use the `Selfie_feat_classify.ipynb` file. 
In order to extract handcraft features (HOG and LBP) use the `ccaselfie.m` and `computecca.m` files.
